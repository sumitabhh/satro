## üé® Color Palette

Your palette needs to be professional, trustworthy, and modern. We'll use a calm blue for trust, a vibrant accent for "AI" actions, and clean neutrals for the interface.

## Typography (Fonts)

Readability is the #1 priority. We will use a professional, clean, and highly legible sans-serif font pairing. Both are available on Google Fonts and are standards for modern UI design.

1. Headings & Dashboard Widgets

Font: Figtree

Why: It's modern, clean, and has a slightly rounded, friendly personality. It feels authoritative yet approachable, perfect for a "mentor."

Weights: Use Semi-Bold (600) for widget titles and Bold (700) for major headings (e.g., "Dashboard").

2. Body & UI Text (Chat, Buttons, Labels)

Font: Inter

Why: This is the gold standard for UI text. It was designed specifically for screen readability at all sizes, from tiny labels to full paragraphs. It's neutral, clean, and professional.

Weights: Use Regular (400) for body text/chat and Medium (500) for button text and important labels.

## ü™Ñ Icon Style

Consistency in your icons is crucial for a professional look.

Style: Line (or Outline)

Why: Line icons are minimalist, modern, and clean. They don't distract from the content and match your clean font choice. Solid/filled icons can feel heavy and dated.

Details:

Use a consistent stroke-width (e.g., 2px).

Look for a set with slightly rounded corners to match the friendly feel of your fonts.

Recommended Library: Lucide Icons

This is the default icon library for shadcn/ui for a reason. It's open-source, massive, and perfectly matches this branding.

Examples: layout-dashboard, message-square, file-text, calendar, settings, log-out.

## Logo & Naming

Your name and logo should instantly communicate what you do.

Name Ideas:

Lemma: (A "helping proof" in math/logic. Smart, short, academic).

K≈çpa: (Short for "Co-pilot." Friendly and modern).

Academa: (Academic + AI).

Orbital: (Your personal guide that revolves around your academic life).

Nexus: (The central point connecting all your student tools).

Logo Design:

Keep it simple. A logomark (an icon) is better than a complex text logo.

Concept 1: A stylized letter "L" (for Lemma) that also looks like a chat bubble.

Concept 2: A "brain" icon merged with a "circuit" icon, colored in your Accent Violet.

Concept 3: An "orbit" icon with a central node, representing the app as the center of the student's universe.
